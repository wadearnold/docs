Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Here you will find documentation to help you start building with Moov as quickly as possible. If you get stuck along the way, we are always here to help! Moov Projects \u00b6 Moov projects are focused on solving a single responsibility capability in financial services. Projects can be leveraged as a RESTFul service or GoLang library and are built from source into an OS specific binary and docker container. Deployment of Moov projects can be deployed as a binary on your application server, as a docker container, or leverage the our hosted API api.moov.io endpoints. Payments \u00b6 Process funds with the following settlement methods: Moov ACH (including Same Day ACH) implements a NACHA compliant RESTFul API for file creation, parsing, and validation. Supports generating and parsing all Standard Entry Class (SEC) codes. ACH is the primary method of electronic money movement throughout the United States. Moov PayGate provides a complete implementation of ACH origination (file creation), OFAC checks, micro-deposits, SFTP uploading, and other features to be a complete system for ACH transfers. Moov Wire (domestic Fedwire) implements an interface to write files for the Fedwire Funds Service, a real-time gross settlement funds transfer system operated by the United States Federal Reserve Banks. These compatible files include routing instructions that, once received and processed, will debit the funds from the sending bank's reserve account at their Federal Reserve bank and credit the receiving bank's account. Wire transfers sent via Fedwire are completed in the same day, while some are completed instantly. Moov Image Cash Letter implements Image Cash Letter (ICL) files used for Check21 or Check truncation files for exchange and remote deposit in the U.S.; also known as X9 files, X9.37 files, X9.100-187 Account Creation \u00b6 Common functionality for creating funding accounts Moov Customers The Customers project focuses on solving authentic identification of humans who are legally able to hold and transfer currency within the US. Primarily this project solves Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer Identification Program (CIP), Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) checks and verification workflows to comply with US federal law and ensure authentic transfers. Moov Accounts is an RESTful API implementation of an accounting General Ledger used to track monetary transfers in digital systems. Moov OFAC Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) is an HTTP API and Go library to download, parse and serve United States OFAC sanction data for applications and humans. Moov FED implements utility services for searching the United States Federal Reserve System such as ABA routing numbers, Financial Institution name lookup and Fed Wire routing information. Design Goals \u00b6 The core principles underlying Moov are performance, scalability, and ease-of-use. Based on these principles, Moov is designed around the following core features: Highly performant (fast) Few opinions, lightly held (interoperability) Extremely lightweight (small footprint) Support client languages (polyglot clients) micro building blocks (single responsibility principle) Getting Help \u00b6 channel info moov-io slack Join our slack channel to have an interactive discussion about the development of the project.

NOT SURE WHERE THIS GOES !

Each file begins with a File Header record. Following the File Header Record may be any number of batches. Each batch is identified by a Batch Header Record and contains one or more Entry Detail Records. At the end of each batch is a Batch Control Record. Each file is ended with a File Control Record. The diagram on the following page illustrates the Sequence of Records for ACH entries. The sequence of records will always be the same, regardless of SEC code. Out-of- sequence records or lack of a mandatory record will cause all or portions of the file to reject. Padding with \u201c9\u201d records at the end of the file is optional. Input File Descriptions \u00b6 File Header \u00b6 The File Header Record designates physical file characteristics and identifies the immediate origin of the entries contained within the file or within the transmitted batched data. In addition, this record includes date, time, and file identification fields that can be used to uniquely identify the file. Company/Batch Header Record \u00b6 The Company/Batch Header Record identifies the Originator and briefly describes the purpose of the entries that are contained within the batch. For example, \u201cGAS BILL\u201d or \u201cREG SALARY\u201d indicates the reason for the transaction originated by the Originator. It also indicates the intended effective entry date of all transactions within the batch. The information contained in the Company/Batch Header Record applies uniformly to all subsequent Entry Detail Records in the batch. If you wish to vary any of this information, you must create a separate batch. For example, if you are making regular payroll payments and bonus payments then you should create one batch described as \u201cREG SALARY\u201d and another as \u201cBONUS.\u201d Entry Detail Record \u00b6 Entry Detail Records contain information that relate the specific entry to the Receiver, such as the Receiving Depository Financial Institution account and routing transit number and the debit or credit amount. Prenotifications (prenotes) are special zero-dollar entries used to test the validity of the account number and transit routing number provided by the Receiver. Prenotes are identical to the basic Entry Detail format but contain appropriate Transaction Codes and zeroes in the amount field. Prenotes can be batched with other dollar entries or batched separately. Zero-dollar entries used in corporate trade payments to deliver remittance information contain appropriate Transaction Codes and zeros in the Amount field but otherwise are formatted the same as other entries. Zero-dollar entries can be batched with other CCD dollar entries or batched separately. One Addenda Record must accompany a CCD zero- dollar entry. Addenda Records \u00b6 For non-IAT entries, Addenda Records are used by the Originator to supply additional information about Entry Detail Records to the Receiver. For many types of entries, such as payroll, addenda records are optional. Addenda Records are usually required for tax payments. Company/Batch Control Record \u00b6 The Company/Batch Control Record contains the counts, hash totals, and total dollar controls for the preceding detail entries within the indicated batch. All Entry Detail Records are hashed. (The method for calculating hash totals is provided in the Entry Information column in the Record Layouts.) Both Entry Detail Records and Addenda Records are included in the entry/addenda counts; Batch Header and Batch Control Records are not included. File Control Record \u00b6 The File Control Record contains dollar, entry, and hash total accumulations from the Company/Batch Control Records in the file. This record also contains counts of the number of blocks and the number of batches within the file (or batched data transmitted to a single destination). NACHA Data Entry Specifications \u00b6 All alphanumeric and alphabetic fields must be left justified and space filled. All numeric fields must be right justified, unsigned, and zero filled. Characters used in ACH records are restricted to 0-9, A-Z, space, and those special characters which have an EBCDIC value greater than hexadecimal \"3F\" or an ASCII value greater than hexadecimal \"1F.\u201d Occurrences of values EBCDIC \"00\" - \"3F\" and ASCII \"00\" - \"1F\" are not valid. Do not use characters that do not meet these requirements. Field Inclusion Requirements \u00b6 The following information defines the requirement for inclusion of certain data fields in ACH entries. These designations are: Mandatory (M), Required (R), and Optional (O). Mandatory. A \u201cMandatory\u201d field contains information necessary to ensure the proper routing and/or posting of an ACH entry. The ACH Operator will reject any entry or batch, which does not have appropriate values in a Mandatory field. Required. The omission of a \u201cRequired\u201d field will not cause an entry reject at the ACH Operator, but may cause a reject at the RDFI. For example, if the DFI Account Number field in the Entry Detail Record is omitted, the RDFI may return the entry because it cannot be posted. You should include appropriate values in \u201cRequired\u201d fields to avoid processing and control problems at the RDFI. Optional. The inclusion or omission of an \u201cOptional\u201d data field is at the discretion of the Originator. If you do include optional fields, the RDFI must include them in any return. Annotated NACHA Record Formats \u00b6 File Header Record - All Formats \u00b6 The File Header Record designates physical file characteristics.

ACH processes large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches. ACH credit transfers include direct deposit, payroll and vendor payments. ACH direct debit transfers include consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other kinds of bills. Debit transfers also include new applications such as the point-of-purchase (POP) check conversion pilot program sponsored by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA). Both the government and the commercial sectors use ACH payments. Businesses increasingly use ACH online to have customers pay, rather than via credit or debit cards. source: Automated Clearing House How does ACH work? \u00b6 NACHA includes Members in the process of establishing Rules for the ACH Network, working collaboratively to create a clear picture of participant roles and responsibilities in the following ACH transaction process. An Originator\u2013 whether that\u2019s an individual, a corporation or another entity\u2013 initiates either a Direct Deposit or Direct Payment transaction using the ACH Network. ACH transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include Direct Deposit of payroll, government and Social Security benefits, mortgage and bill payments, online banking payments, person-to-person (P2P) and business-to-business (B2B) payments, to name a few. Instead of using paper checks, ACH entries are entered and transmitted electronically, making transactions quicker, safer and easier. The Originating Depository Financial institution (ODFI) enters the ACH entry at the request of the Originator. The ODFI aggregates payments from customers and transmits them in batches at regular, predetermined intervals to an ACH Operator. ACH Operators (two central clearing facilities: The Federal Reserve or The Clearing House) receive batches of ACH entries from the ODFI.

ACH processes large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches. ACH credit transfers include direct deposit, payroll and vendor payments. ACH direct debit transfers include consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other kinds of bills. Debit transfers also include new applications such as the point-of-purchase (POP) check conversion pilot program sponsored by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA). Both the government and the commercial sectors use ACH payments. Businesses increasingly use ACH online to have customers pay, rather than via credit or debit cards. source: Automated Clearing House","title":"What is ACH"},{"location":"ach/intro/#how-does-ach-work","text":"NACHA includes Members in the process of establishing Rules for the ACH Network, working collaboratively to create a clear picture of participant roles and responsibilities in the following ACH transaction process. An Originator\u2013 whether that\u2019s an individual, a corporation or another entity\u2013 initiates either a Direct Deposit or Direct Payment transaction using the ACH Network. ACH transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include Direct Deposit of payroll, government and Social Security benefits, mortgage and bill payments, online banking payments, person-to-person (P2P) and business-to-business (B2B) payments, to name a few. Instead of using paper checks, ACH entries are entered and transmitted electronically, making transactions quicker, safer and easier. The Originating Depository Financial institution (ODFI) enters the ACH entry at the request of the Originator. The ODFI aggregates payments from customers and transmits them in batches at regular, predetermined intervals to an ACH Operator. ACH Operators (two central clearing facilities: The Federal Reserve or The Clearing House) receive batches of ACH entries from the ODFI. The ACH transactions are sorted and made available by the ACH Operator to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI). The Receiver\u2019s account is debited or credited by the RDFI, according to the type of ACH entry. Individuals, businesses and other entities can all be Receivers.

When lower case letters are used, they shall be interpreted to have the same meaning as their respective upper case letters, e.g., no distinction shall be made between the upper case letter A and the lower case letter a. Numeric (N) \u00b6 The numeric characters are the numbers zero (0) through nine (9). Blank (B) \u00b6 The blank character is defined in ASCII with the hexadecimal value \u201820\u2019 and in EBCDIC with the hexadecimal value \u201840\u2019; also referred to as a space. Special characters (S) \u00b6 Special characters are any of the printable characters listed in the table below.

Alphameric/special (ANS) \u00b6 An Alphameric/special character is any one of the alphabetic, numeric, or special characters. X9.100-187\u20132016 \u00b6 Numericblank (NB): A numericblank character is any one of the numeric characters or the blank character. Blanks shall not be embedded within the numeric digits. Blanks may be used only to fill out a field when the numeric value length is shorter than the actual field length. Leading zeros may be present but shall not be removed or added. Numericblank fields, when present, shall contain at least one numeric character and shall not be all blanks. Numeric/special (NS): A numeric/special is any one of the numeric characters or special characters. Binary: The binary data type is composed of a sequence of bytes where each byte ranges in value from binary 00000000 to 11111111 (8-bit encoding). The syntax, semantics, and number of bytes in the string are specified in the standard for each occurrence of the binary data type. Special MICR line data types \u00b6 The MICR line on a check is composed of a series of symbols. The MICR symbols for numbers shall be represented by the numeric values zero (0) through nine (9). However, the MICR symbols for delineation of data on the MICR line do not have any graphic equivalents. Therefore, certain special characters shall be used to interpret these MICR symbols. These special characters shall have these special meanings only when used in fields directly read from the MICR line. When these same special characters are used elsewhere in other fields they shall represent their actual value. Asterisk (*): The asterisk character shall be used to represent the presence of MICR when the processing system cannot interpret the MICR as a specific valid MICR character. Dash (-): The dash character shall be used to represent the presence of the MICR symbol for a dash. Forward slash (/): The forward slash character shall be used to represent the presence of the MICR symbol for \u2018On-Us\u2019. Numericblank/special MICR (NBSM): A numericblank/special MICR character is any one of the numeric characters, the blank character, the dash character, or asterisk character. Numericblank/special MICR On-Us (NBSMOS): A numericblank/special MICR On-Us character is any one of the numeric characters, the blank character, the asterisk character, the dash character, or the forward slash character. Fill data \u00b6 Fill data are any characters used to fill up unused bytes in a field. Fill characters shall be blanks or zeros. Data justification \u00b6 Justification is the act of aligning data as it is placed into a field, based on its right or leftmost character. Right justification \u00b6 A field is right justified when the data is aligned based on its rightmost character. Left justification \u00b6 A field is left justified when the data is aligned based on its leftmost character. General Field Format \u00b6 The following shall apply to all fields on all records in the standard: A field defined as alphameric (AN), alphabetic (A), Alphameric/special (ANS), or numericblank (NB) shall be left justified and blank filled. A field defined as numeric (N) shall be right justified and zero filled A field defined as numericblank/special MICR (NBSM) or numericblank/special MICR On-Us (NBSMOS) shall be right justified and blank filled A field defined as numeric/special (NS) shall be left justified and blank filled. A field defined as special (S) shall be left justified and blank filled. If a field is mandatory or conditional and not blank, and has predefined values, it shall contain one of these predefined values or it is invalid. If a field is conditional and not used then it shall contain all blanks regardless of the data type. Fixed length fields that are conditional and are not used shall be filled with Blanks. Variable length fields that are not used (i.e. size =0) are omitted. Amount Fields \u00b6 All amounts fields have two implied decimal points, e.g., $1,234.67 is entered as 0000123467. User Fields \u00b6 Most records of the file provide for User Fields. Users of the standard utilize these fields at their discretion. The standard does not define particular uses for, or the internal contents of, these fields. In many cases, the user fields within the records are more than one character in length. Users are free to use the field as a single field or divide it into multiple fields.

(API docs: company or customers ) This allows services to monitor for changes to the OFAC data. There's an example app that receives webhooks written in Go. OFAC sends either a Company or Customer model in JSON to the webhook URL. Webhook URLs MUST be secure (https://...) and an Authorization header is sent with an auth token provided when setting up the webhook.
